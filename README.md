# Crisp

A minimalist, responsive, and open-source theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) by [Kathy Qian](http://kathyqian.com).

### Enabling Disqus comments
This theme requires a variable called 'disqus' to be defined in your **config.toml** for your Hugo site.

Make sure that the variable 'disqus' is defined in the 'Params' section, like so:

```
[Params]

disqus = "replace-this-with-your-disqus-shortname"
```

### Editing Follow Buttons

Crisp uses Font Awesome for icons. See the Font Awesome documentation for the [full list of icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and [usage tips](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/).

I have placed some common buttons in **follow.hbs**, with more options in the commented out sections. Make sure to replace the `username` in the URLs so the links point to your profiles.

Many thanks to [@davegandy](http://twitter.com/davegandy) for the [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) icons used throughout the theme.

Social sharing buttons are a modified version of the [Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) by [@dbox](http://www.twitter.com/dbox) and [@seagoat](http://www.twitter.com/seagoat). Great job, guys!
